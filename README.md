Medicinal Remedies

This project is an interactive web application designed to help users explore natural remedies for common symptoms such as headaches, colds, and digestive issues. It demonstrates my understanding of front-end web development, responsive design, and a Node.js/Express server setup.

Features

Symptom-based remedy suggestions

Dynamic content updates using JavaScript

Responsive design for both mobile and desktop views

Organized project structure with static file serving via Express

Clean, accessible, and semantic HTML markup

Data analysis using arrays, objects, sets, or maps

Regular expression validation to prevent invalid user input

Custom functions that accept multiple parameters and return calculated values

User-friendly data visualization using charts (Chart.js)

Responsive Design

Mobile-first layout with a desktop breakpoint at 768px

On smaller screens, content stacks vertically for readability

On larger screens, the remedies section switches to a two-column grid

Technologies Used
Frontend

HTML5

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)

Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)

Backend

Node.js

Express.js

CORS and dotenv for configuration
